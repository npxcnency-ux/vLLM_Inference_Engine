"""
tests/test_scheduler.py — Unit tests for the Phase 2 continuous batching scheduler.

All tests use a session-scoped real model fixture (same pattern as Phase 1's
test_sequential.py) — no mocking.  This properly validates the actual
scheduler + model interaction.

Run with:
    cd /Users/nikhilmourya/Desktop/PageServe
    pytest inference_engine/tests/test_scheduler.py -v

Tests
-----
1. test_single_request_through_scheduler
   Add one request, run the scheduler loop for N steps, verify state=="finished".

2. test_multiple_requests_admitted
   Add 3 requests to a scheduler with max_batch_size=4.
   Verify all 3 reach "decoding" state within 5 scheduler steps.

3. test_finished_sequences_removed
   Verify a finished sequence is removed from scheduler.running.

4. test_queue_wait_time_recorded
   Verify queue_wait_time_ms > 0 for each finished sequence.

5. test_batch_size_never_exceeds_max
   Add 10 requests, run the scheduler, verify len(running) <= max_batch_size
   at every recorded batch_size_over_time sample.

Note on asyncio in pytest
--------------------------
Each test that drives the scheduler loop uses asyncio.run() inside a standard
(non-async) test function.  This avoids a pytest-asyncio dependency while
still exercising the full async scheduler path.
