"""
engine/sequence.py — Sequence state dataclass for the Phase 2 continuous
batching scheduler.

Each request submitted to the scheduler is wrapped in a Sequence object that
carries all mutable state through its lifetime:


    waiting   →  prefill   →  decoding   →  finished
       ↑ created    ↑ admitted    ↑ first token    ↑ EOS or max_new_tokens

    waiting   →  chunked_prefilling  →  decoding   →  finished
       ↑ created    ↑ admitted (chunked)   ↑ all chunks done

    waiting   →  expired    (timed out in queue before prefill)
    waiting   →  cancelled  (explicit cancel before prefill)
    decoding  →  swapped    (KV blocks evicted to CPU under memory pressure;
                             re-enters decoding after swap-in)

    Full valid states in lifecycle order:
        waiting | prefill | chunked_prefilling | decoding | finished | expired | cancelled | swapped

The `past_key_values` field holds the per-sequence HuggingFace KV cache.
Storing KV caches per-sequence is the Phase 2 approach; unified KV cache
management (with eviction/swapping) is Phase 9.

Memory note: for Qwen2-0.5B (fp16) each sequence's KV cache grows by
approximately 3 MB per generated token.  At max_batch_size=4 and
max_new_tokens=50 this adds ~600 MB on top of the ~950 MB model weight
footprint.  Keep max_batch_size ≤ 4 and max_new_tokens ≤ 50 unless you have
confirmed available headroom.

@dataclass
class Sequence:
    """Full mutable state for one scheduled generation request.

    Fields
    ------
    seq_id
        UUID4 hex string — unique identifier for this sequence.
    prompt
        Raw text of the user prompt.
    prompt_token_ids
        Token-id list produced by the tokenizer for `prompt`.
    generated_token_ids
        Token ids produced so far, including the first token from prefill.
        Grows by one per scheduler decode step.
    max_new_tokens
        Upper bound on tokens to generate.
    state
        Lifecycle state.  Mutated exclusively by the scheduler or
        RequestQueue:

        Normal path:   ``"waiting"`` → ``"prefill"`` → ``"decoding"`` → ``"finished"``
        Chunked path:  ``"waiting"`` → ``"chunked_prefilling"`` → ``"decoding"`` → ``"finished"``
        Timeout path:  ``"waiting"`` → ``"expired"``
        Cancel path:   ``"waiting"`` → ``"cancelled"``
        Swap path:     ``"decoding"`` → ``"swapped"`` → ``"decoding"``

        All valid states:
            ``waiting | prefill | chunked_prefilling | decoding | finished | expired | cancelled | swapped``
    past_key_values
        HuggingFace KV cache returned by the last model forward pass.
        ``None`` until prefill completes.
    ttft_ms
        Time-to-first-token in milliseconds.  Set at the end of prefill.
    arrival_time
        ``time.perf_counter()`` timestamp when the Sequence was created.
        Used to compute ``queue_wait_time_ms``.
    first_token_time
        ``time.perf_counter()`` timestamp when the first generated token was
        appended (i.e. at the end of prefill).  ``0.0`` until then.
    per_token_latencies_ms
        Wall-clock latency (ms) for each individual decode step.
        Does **not** include the prefill step; that is captured in ``ttft_ms``.
    finish_reason
        ``"length"``  — stopped because ``len(generated_token_ids) >= max_new_tokens``
        ``"eos"``     — stopped because EOS token was produced
        ``""``        — not yet finished
    queue_wait_time_ms
        Time (ms) from ``arrival_time`` to the moment prefill began.
        Set by the scheduler when the sequence is admitted from the waiting
        queue.  ``0.0`` until then.
    prefill_offset
        Number of prompt tokens already processed in chunked-prefill mode.
        Starts at 0; advances by ``prefill_chunk_size`` each step; once it
        reaches ``len(prompt_token_ids)`` the sequence transitions to
        ``"decoding"``.  Unused in the legacy full-prefill path.
    prefill_chunk_size
        Tokens to process per scheduler step during chunked prefill.
        Frozen at admission time from ``config.prefill_chunk_size``.
    prefill_start_time
        ``time.perf_counter()`` when the first chunk began.  Used to compute
        TTFT across potentially multiple chunks.  ``0.0`` until the first
        chunk starts.
